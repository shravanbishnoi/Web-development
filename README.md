# Web Development Journey 🚀
Welcome to my Web Development repository! 😎

This is my personal collection of apps built while learning and mastering React and other web technologies. It's a fun journey of exploration and discovery, filled with code experiments, apps, and cool projects. I'm pushing everything I create during my web development course here!

## What's Inside? 💻
- React Apps: My learning playground! This includes a variety of projects I've worked on, each showcasing different features and concepts.
- From Basics to Pro: You'll find everything from simple components to more complex apps as I level up my skills.
- Experimentation: Expect some weird, wild, and geeky stuff—because coding is all about trying new things and learning through mistakes. 🙃

## Projects So Far 🚧
- First App: My starting point in web development, featuring basic React components.
- Greeting Page: A simple page that welcomes users with a greeting message.
- Counter: A functional counter app that increments, decrements, and resets values.
